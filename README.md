# 🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset: A Deep Dive into Data Insights

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **SkillCraft Technology** (August 2025).  
The task involved performing **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to identify survival patterns and trends.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using the Titanic dataset, I explored relationships between features such as:
- Passenger class
- Gender
- Age
- Embarkation port  
...and their effect on survival outcomes.

All code was executed in **Google Colab**, and a **PowerPoint presentation** was created to summarize the findings using project screenshots.
